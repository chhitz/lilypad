This is a simple text editing application, called LilyPad, that is
shipped with the LilyPond Windows installers.  It is written in C
using the Windows API, and is a "fork" of the Wine Notepad,
extracted from Wine's CVS repo on 2005-05-15.

Follow these steps to build LilyPad from this repo:

* Run

    ./autogen.sh

* Create a tarball of the source (FIXME: need a `dist' target)

* Modify the LilyPad GUB (http://lilypond.org/gub) spec to
prepare for cross compilation.  The spec is currently located in
gub/specs/lilypad.py.  For example, assign the path of the tarball
to the source variable:

    source = 'file:///home/user/lilypad-0.0.something.tar.bz2'

* Build (and install) LilyPad:

    bin/gub mingw::lilypad

* You'll find LilyPad here:

    $ ls target/mingw/root/usr/bin | grep lilypad
    lilypad-ascii.exe
    lilypad.exe
