As of 2012 Feb 12, this is the latest repository for lilypad (the
build-in editors for lilypond on OSX and windows).

Notes:
- this is the code which is used for our official GUB binaries.

- **DOES NOT** contain work that Patrick did on 2010-01-19:
    http://repo.or.cz/w/lilypad-macos.git
  the same commits appear in this repository:
    https://github.com/pnorcks/lilypad-macos

- contains all code that Patrick wrote here:
    http://repo.or.cz/w/lilypad-windows.git
    https://github.com/pnorcks/lilypad-windows
  **HOWEVER** gub only uses the lilypad-0.0.8 source tarball,
  which means that Patrick's work since 2010-07-08 has not
  appeared in any GUB release.
